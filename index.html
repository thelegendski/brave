    JUDGEZ:
        1. all code has been optimized to an absurd degree.
        2. used the integrity attribute with script tagz for
            proper codin' practice
        3. all code fully employs advanced [an' complex as you will soon see] ES6+ syntax an' featurez
        4. pls don't dock for code you don't understand. just ask a question down below so i can explain; simply 'cuz you can't read it doesn't mean it's wrong, :).
